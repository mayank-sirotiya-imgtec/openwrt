Subject: SPFI: reset SPFI hw block at the beginning of each transaction

Before configuring the next transaction it's good to make sure
the process is started from a known (reset) state and that the
SPFI hardware block was not left in a state that might influence
the new transaction. Making sure of this eliminates an SPFI
transaction timeout that was noticed to happen intermittently
after a large number of transactions.
